- An account can be created from the sign-up page by entering username and password.

- There is a "+ NEW LIST" button which opens up the create a new list page. A new list can be created by only entering the name of the list followed by pressing a button "Create".
- Inside a list, separate tasks can be created by using the "+" button.
- Corresponding to each task within a list, there are two more buttons: delete and edit the respective task. 
- To complete a task, click on the task itself. That will set the task to 'complete'. 
- Every list has two buttons as well: edit (to change the name of the list) and delete.
